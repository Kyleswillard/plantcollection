## A modified version of Lambda School Build Week Project - Water My Plants


### Changed from being focused on inclusion of IOS developers to purely web by ignoring timers, and notifications, and instead creating a Full Stack project that focused on full stack development, and use of both internal APIs and External Apis to create a solid fleshed out project to present on my portfolio. Also will serve as an example to others that attend Lambda School between SQL & NoSQL. 


### Stack Used: TypeScript, React, Redux, Thunk, Apollo Client/Server Node, Mongoose, Express, GraphQL, MongoDB, AND MORE!
